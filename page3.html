       <h3>Creating the future from the past</h3>

        Student unions and campus centers have greatly evolved over recent decades. Educational spaces intended for studying predominantly consisted of tables, desks, upright chairs, and bulky computer equipment in the 1990’s, but have since transformed to adopt a “new approach to learning spaces focused on atmosphere, ﬂexibility and accessibility instead” (Walton and Matthews, p. 38), therefore drastically changing the stereotypical furniture layout. Now, seating variation and placement is of the utmost important, and rarely does it follow the rules of rows and columns. Strange and Banning discussed how “The proxemics associated with seating arrangements in a lounge area can either promote or inhibit social inter-action,” (p. 31) and how there should be a variety between the two options. Within the spatial arrangement, the style of furniture should be considered as well; Gayeski mentions that “Comfort is key” (81) because, similar to the entrance, students must be comfortable not just mentally but also physically before being able to successfully immerse themselves and concentrate in the space.<br><br>
Including varying options from lounging to upright desk position ensures that a variety of users can ﬁnd a spot that ﬁts their needs. As detailed in Design for the Changing Educational Landscape, this “...may include the provision of low chairs, soft seating and coffee tables to allow for comfortable browsing,” and “the inclusion of small tables and appropriate height chairs for group work and a separate study and appropriate furniture and storage to support the use of technology” (Harrison and Hutton, p. 103). Applying this assortment of proximities and furniture styles creates an effective space for a diverse population of students, allowing for the user to determine the conﬁnes that encourage the most productivity based on learning style and personal preference.

        <p>Each student has their own unique combination of traits that dictate how and where they most successfully generate quality work and concentration. Walton and Matthews subscribe to this theory, stating that “...the paradigm of learning as contextualised construction of knowledge requires a diversiﬁcation of learning envi-ronments” (p. 40). People learn best in different modes and settings, and therefore need differing resources in order to have maximum productivity while learning and working. As discussed in Designing Communication and Learning Environments, there are multiple personalitytypes based on the Myers-Briggs evaluation, and each type generally correlates to a certain working environment style. Some examples of Myers-Briggs personality type work preferences are: ofﬁces with lots of reference materials and few distractions, ofﬁce space with room for personalization and momentos, office environment with action and sounds but little personal items, and ofﬁces with room for social collaboration and close proximity to others (Gayeski, 5). <br><br>Different facilities have approached this challenge in many ways. Some tackle the issue by introducing an emphasis on seating and furniture that “support(s) the easy reconﬁguration of the spaces” (Harrison and Hutton, p. 103) to satisfy the demands of different learning activities and styles. Walton and Matthews agreed, mentioning that learners choose their desired work space based on their personal preferences and style as well as their intended learning activity (p. 49). A quoted source from Harrison and Hutton summarized it best: “To be a balanced and negotiable place to work, a building or ofﬁce or any workplace must be thought of as a dynamic, living thing that allows for varieties of work and people” (p. 6). Without the inclusion of different social environments, seating arrangements, movable furniture, and space for technology, the learning space is less likely to accomplish its anticipated purposes for an entire population of students. </p></article>  </div>

    <h2>How should we design for such a diverse, constantly fluctuating population?</h2>
    
       <h3>Designing a versatile student community space</h3>
      
 <p> 
        All of the chosen texts recognized the importance of composing the physical space within a working and learning environment in terms of very speciﬁc distinctions. This attention to detail does not just start with the work environment, but with the entrance itself. “With a more inviting entrance design and less intimidating wayﬁnding, the probability of becoming engaged in intellectual activities is increased” (Strange and Banning, 31). Students may be deterred from utilizing the space if they feel awkward simply entering or if they encounter difﬁculties in simple tasks within the space, such as wayﬁnding. <br><br>
Students must feel comfortable and uninhibited in their environment in order to be thoroughly productive. According to Walton and Matthews, a survey found that “...the quality of building design had a positive impact on staff and students’ decisions to work, or study, at their chosen [Higher Education] provider” (p. 24). Many factors relate to the perceived quality of a learning space: sounds, smells, seating options, temperature, lighting, color, proximity, and more. These situational factors also have an impact on the emotional excitement of a person, which can be pleasant or not, and often are avoided in educational environments (Harrison and Hutton, 5). On a similar note, Harrison and Hutton also state that while “a moderate level of arousal might adversely affect performance on a complex task, it can actually help perfor-mance on simple ones” (5). Therefore, effective learning spaces should include areas for both moderate and lower levels of emotional arousal, so that students can balance different spaces with different tasks.

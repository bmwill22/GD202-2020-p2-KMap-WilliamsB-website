       <h3>Meeting the needs of all with one building<br> </h3>
      
 <article><p> 
        In order to make sure that spaces are meeting the needs of as many students as possible, you often can not rely solely on research and previous success cases. Getting the actual intended users to participate in the creation of a campus center geared towards studying collaboratively and independently greatly increases the chances of legitimately meeting their needs (Strange and Banning, p. 32). Yet independent study is not typically the main source of research and focus; multiple sources mention the growing demand for collaborative, community based centers that incorporate social learning, group, and informal learning (Walton and Matthews, p. 26). The demand is based on growing evidence and research that the social aspects of learning and cooperation are signiﬁcant to a large part of the university student population. Social learning inherently promotes and encourages the idea of community; cohesion and compatibility among people in shared spaces that creates uniformity and consistency.<br><br>
The culture of a campus center relates back to the original topic of a space’s physicality, but also has the potential to “promote a feeling of high-tech, high energy, and progress towards goals” (Gayeski, p. 9) that is often reﬂected by the students that surround themselves with that kind of environment. Whatever visual environment is created for the space will not only impact the amounts of productivity but will also inﬂuence the attitudes, culture, and motivations of the student population that take advantage of the center’s resources. <br><br>
Due to varying ﬂoors and the distinctive architectural style of Talley, each level of the building provides a different atmosphere. Students agree that as you ascend the stairs, there is less noise, less social interactions, and more people concentrated and focused on their individual tasks. The noise and sounds of people from the bustling, food-centric second ﬂoor rises up to the ﬂoors above, but gradually reduces as you get farther up, mirroring the atmospheres. However, the amount of quiet hallways and corners increases as you go up. Many students prefer the lack of distraction on the upper ﬂoors while they focus on schoolwork, but others are intimidated by the socially accepted quiet zones. The ﬁrst ﬂoor is primarily host to the bookstore and a coffee shop, and there is very little neutral space for studying or socializing. The second ﬂoor holds almost all of the regular food options in the building, along with the most open seating areas, also referred to as lounges, which are utilized differently depending on the student and the time of day. The third ﬂoor is primarily composed of event spaces; ballrooms, meeting rooms, and a theater. The fourth and ﬁfth ﬂoor are more diverse, hosting different student organizations, ofﬁces, and conference rooms as well as offering open lounge space throughout. Students primarily come to Talley to eat, socialize with friends, study with a group, or study independently. </p>  </article>
    
<div class="conclusion">
        Talley Student Union provides a unique example of a student community space, demonstrating the theories and ideas described by various researchers. The diversity among the different ﬂoors and sections of the building allow for each student to ﬁnd somewhere suitable for their needs, whether they prefer quiet or loud spaces, social or private areas, comfortable or rigid seating, hidden corners or open space. Its versatility allows for both large groups and individuals to do a variety of activities, creating an eclectic mix of social and study. The individual determines how they use the space and what Talley means to them. </div> </div>
